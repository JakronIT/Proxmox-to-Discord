# Proxmox to Discord Webhook Forwarder üöÄ

A lightweight Docker service that receives webhook notifications from Proxmox and forwards them to Discord channels with smart filtering and beautiful formatting.

## ‚ú® Features

- üéØ **Smart Filtering**: Route notifications by severity and source IP
- üìù **Beautiful Messages**: Clean Discord formatting with emojis and embeds
- üìé **Long Message Support**: Auto-converts long messages to file attachments
- üê≥ **Docker Ready**: Easy deployment with Docker Compose
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Simple Config**: YAML-based configuration

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JakronIT/Proxmox-to-Discord.git
cd Proxmox-to-Discord
```

Edit `config.yaml` and set your Discord webhook URLs.

**Structure of `config.yaml`:**

- `webhooks`: a list of Discord webhooks to which notifications will be sent
    - `url`: Discord webhook URL
    - `severity`: list of severity levels to be forwarded to this webhook (`any` or e.g. `["warning", "error"]`)
    - `source`: list of IP addresses from which notifications should be forwarded (`any` or specific IPs)

Example:

```yaml
webhooks:
  - url: "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/YOUR_WEBHOOK_ID/YOUR_WEBHOOK_TOKEN"
    severity: ["any"]
    source: ["any"]
  # - url: "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/ANOTHER_WEBHOOK_ID/ANOTHER_WEBHOOK_TOKEN"
  #   severity: ["warning", "error", "critical"]
  #   source: ["192.168.1.10"]
```

Start the service:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

The service will be available at `http://localhost:5000`
